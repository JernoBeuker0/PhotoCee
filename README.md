# PhotoCee

Hello welcome to the PhotoCee github!

The initial reason for this github is to share the code for running the script to change names of people in the introweek photobooth.

## Running the code
### Setting up the environment
To run the code, it is nice to set up a venv and install the requirements. So in a venv, do:
 - pip install requirements.txt

### Choose funcionality
At the time of writing, the introweek photobooth is the only functionality that is implemented, so do:
 - git checkout Introweek_Photobooth

Further description on how to run the code is put there.
